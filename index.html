<title>Rolf For Oregon House District 44 &mdash; Write-In Candidate, May 2022 Primary Election</title>

<h1>Rolf Schuler for Oregon House District 44</h1>
<h2>I&rsquo;m running for Oregon House District 44, and I need your vote in November.</h2>

<p><span class="pHead">Who am I?</span> I&rsquo;m your neighbor. Born and raised in N Portland (Overlook), I’ve lived other places around the globe but have been back in Portland since 2008. I’ve been involved with the Multnomah County Republican Party for the past several years. I’ve served as a bonus delegate at the last two platform conventions, helping to shape the Republican party’s platform.</p>

<p><span class="pHead">Why am I running?</span> I am running to give you a choice in November. Career politicians are doing everything they can to grab more power for their selves at the expense of the citizens they were elected to serve. The result is higher taxes, higher prices for everything, increased homeliness, increased crime, streets that are no longer safe... I am not a politician, I&rsquo;m just a citizen who wants to see an end to the reckless non-sense and blatant disregard for the rule of law that is taking place in Salem.</p>

<p><span class="pHead">What do I stand for?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower taxes and an end to out-of-control inflation.</li>
<li>The rule of law. We don&rsquo;t need new laws, we need to enforce the ones we have. We need to fund and support the police so they can do their job.</li>
<li>Fiscal Responsibility. Salem’s tax-and-spend policies are not working for anyone and are not sustainable.</li>
<li>We need to restore liberty to citizens and stop tyrannical government overreach. Let small business operate without excessive government interference. Let citizens confer with their doctors to make their own medical decisions, rather than have politicians tie the hands of doctors forcing one-size-fits-all medical mandates.</li>
<li>Honor our constitution. Respect the intelligence and abilities of citizens. Less government, more liberty. Total government transparency and accountability.</li>
<li>I support the First Amendment (freedom of religion, speech, press, petition, peaceful assembly); the Second Amendment (the right to own and bear arms); I am pro-constitution; pro-school choice (education, not indoctrination); pro-parent rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your vote. I can&rsquo;t do this without you, but together we can return sanity to Salem.</p>
