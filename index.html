<h1>Rolf Schuler for Oregon House District 44</h1>
<img class="floatright" src="write-in.jpg" alt="ballot image"/>
<h2>I&rsquo;m running as the Republican write-in candidate for Oregon House District 44, and I need your vote. Please write me in on your ballot. My name must be spelled correctly, and remember to fill in the oval.</h2>

<p><span class="pHead">Who am I?</span> I&rsquo;m your neighbor. Born and raised in N Portland (Overlook), I’ve lived other places around the globe but have been back in Portland since 2008. I’ve been involved with the Multnomah County Republican Party for the past several years. I’ve served as a bonus delegate at the last two platform conventions, helping to shape the Republican party’s platform.</p>

<p><span class="pHead">Why am I running?</span> Salem is broken. Career politicians are doing everything they can to grab more power for their selves at the expense of the citizens they were elected to serve. I am not  a politician, I’m just a citizen who wants to see an end to the reckless non-sense and blatant disregard for the rule of law that is taking place in Salem. No one else has stepped up to challenge the incumbent, so I am answering the call to give you a choice in November.</p>

<p><span class="pHead">What do I stand for?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The rule of law. We don’t need new laws, we need to enforce the ones we have. We need to fund and support the police so they can do their job.</li>
<li>Fiscal Responsibility. Salem’s tax-and-spend policies are not working for anyone and are not sustainable.</li>
<li>We need to restore liberty to citizens and stop tyrannical government overreach. Let small business operate without excessive government interference. Let citizens confer with their doctors to make their own medical decisions, rather than have politicians tie the hands of doctors forcing one-size-fits-all medical mandates.</li>
<li>Honor our constitution. Respect the intelligence and abilities of citizens. Less government, more liberty. Total government transparency and accountability.</li>
<li>I support the First Amendment (freedom of religion, speech, press, petition, peaceful assembly); the Second Amendment (the right to own and bear arms); I am pro-constitution; pro-life; pro-school choice (education, not indoctrination); pro-parent rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your write-in-vote. I can&rsquo;t do this without you, but together we can return sanity to Salem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I would also like to encourage you to vote for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governor: <strong>Marc Thielman</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://marcfororegon.com" target="_blank">MarcForOregon</a></li>
<li>Portland Commissioner, position 3: <strong>Joseph Whitcomb</strong> &mdash; <a href="https://josephwhitcomb.wixsite.com/political-candidate" target="_blank">josephwhitcomb.wixsite.com/political-candidate</a></li>
</ul>
